> You’re right: your 073 script is using DS‑MoE. In OpenRLHF, “--zero_stage 2moe” is parsed in get_strategy() to ZeRO‑2 plus moe=True, and get_train_ds_config() inserts a DS “moe” block (num_experts, top_k, use_tutel, capacity_factor, etc.). DeepSpeed-MoE expert parallelism is only supported with ZeRO‑2 today; ZeRO‑3 + MoE remains unsupported/fragile.

  Given only 2×96GB GPUs, here’s how memory shakes out and why you’re OOM.

  Memory accounting (per GPU, bf16, ZeRO‑2, 2 GPUs)

  - Parameters: you measured 58.36 GB just for weights. That implies ~31.3B params (58.36 GiB / 2 bytes).
  - Gradients (bf16):
      - With DP=2 (no EP): ~31.3 GB per GPU (ZeRO‑2 shards grads across DP group).
      - With EP=2 (world=2) DP collapses to 1 → grads are unsharded at ~62.6 GB per GPU. This alone kills the fit.
  - Optimizer states:
      - TorchAO AdamW 8‑bit ≈ 2 bytes/param (m+v), ~62.6 GB if not sharded. If DeepSpeed can partition these across DP=2 under ZeRO‑2 (often it can’t for non-native optimizers), best case ~31.3 GB per GPU.
      - TorchAO AdamW 4‑bit ≈ 1 byte/param, ~31.3 GB (unsharded) or ~15.6 GB (if sharded).
  - Activations:
      - With FA2 + gradient checkpointing at 8k tokens, micro=1 typically costs on the order of 6–10 GB. At micro=16 it will explode.

  What this means for you on 2 GPUs

  - With DP=2 (no expert parallelism), even in the best case where TorchAO states are sharded, you’re looking at:
      - Weights 58.4 + grads ~31.3 + opt 8‑bit ~31.3 + activations 6–10 ≈ 127–131 GB → >96 GB → OOM.
  - With EP=2 (expert parallel over 2 GPUs), DP=1 so ZeRO‑2 cannot shard grads/states. You gain on weights (you’d hold only a fraction of the experts), but you lose all DP sharding:
      - Weights may drop to ~33–40 GB (depends on how much of the model is expert vs shared), but grads jump to ~62.6 GB and 8‑bit states to ~62.6 GB. Total >150 GB → worse than no EP on 2 GPUs.

  Conclusion on EP with 2 GPUs

  - Not recommended. DS‑MoE EP=2 knocks DP down to 1, removing any ZeRO‑2 sharding benefit. You lose more from unsharded grads/optimizer than you save on expert weights. EP only starts to make sense when you have enough GPUs to keep DP>1 (e.g., world=4 with EP=2 gives DP=2).

  What to change first (staying in DS‑MoE + ZeRO‑2, no CPU offload)

  - Slash activations:
      - Set micro_train_batch_size to 1. Confirm fit; then try 2.
      - Temporarily reduce max_len to 4096 to establish headroom; move to 8k after stabilizing.
  - Reduce gradient/optimizer footprints:
      - Add --grad_accum_dtype bf16 so DS doesn’t accumulate grads in fp32 (cuts grad buffers by ~2×).
      - Use --optimizer adamw_torchao_4bit to halve optimizer state from ~62.6 GB → ~31.3 GB (unsharded). This is the largest lever you control without offload.
      - In DS config, enable Zero++ quantization:
          - zero_quantized_gradients: true (cuts gradient memory ~2×; even more critical if DS cannot shard TorchAO states).
          - zero_quantized_weights: true (reduces transient param buffers during comm/updates).
          - Today OpenRLHF sets both to False in get_train_ds_config(); I recommend flipping these to True for your 2‑GPU runs.
  - Keep DP=2:
      - Do not set ring_attn_size > 1 on 2 GPUs; it also reduces DP to 1 in OpenRLHF’s device mesh, which removes ZeRO‑2 sharding.
      - Avoid ds_tensor_parallel_size > 1 for the same reason.
  - Capacity factor:
      - Your dynamic DS config already uses capacity_factor: 1.0 (good). The static zero2_moe.json in this repo uses 1.25 — don’t switch to that; 1.0 is more memory-friendly.
  - Optional memory savers if you can accept minor training compromises:
      - Freeze embeddings and lm_head (saves their grads and optimizer states).
      - Lower top_k for gating (if your Qwen variant allows) to cut expert compute and some activation memory.

  Rough budgets for a feasible configuration on 2×96GB (DP=2, no EP)

  - micro=1, max_len=4096, bf16 grads, quantized grads on (8‑bit), 4‑bit optimizer:
      - Weights: 58.4 GB
      - Grads (quantized): ~15.6 GB
      - Optimizer 4‑bit (likely unsharded): ~31.3 GB
      - Activations (4k, micro=1): ~4–6 GB
      - Total ≈ 109–111 GB → still above 96 GB; you may need one more lever:
          - If DS can shard 4‑bit states across DP=2: opt ~15.6 GB → total ≈ 93–95 GB (fits).
          - Or drop to max_len=3072 temporarily for headroom.
  - micro=1, max_len=8192, bf16 grads, quantized grads, 4‑bit optimizer:
      - Activations ~7–10 GB → total ~113–116 GB (w/ unsharded 4‑bit states) → likely OOM.
      - With sharded 4‑bit states: ~97–99 GB → borderline.

  So the path forward is:

  - Try micro=1 and max_len=4096 with --grad_accum_dtype bf16, TorchAO 4‑bit optimizer, and Zero++ quantized grads enabled in DS config. If it fits, either:
      - Try max_len=8k (will be tight unless your 4‑bit optimizer states are partitioned), or
      - Keep 4k and scale micro to 2.

  Compute efficiency

  - Yes, DS‑MoE is compute‑efficient (only top‑k experts run). Your bottleneck is memory, not flops. With 2 GPUs and no EP, you still hold all experts’ weights, so memory is the limiting factor. Once you fit, FA2 + checkpointing + packing give good throughput for the hardware.

  Concrete edits I recommend for 073 and OpenRLHF

  - 073 script:
      - Change: --micro_train_batch_size 1
      - Change: --max_len 4096 initially
      - Add: --grad_accum_dtype bf16
      - Change: --optimizer adamw_torchao_4bit
      - Keep: --attn_implementation flash_attention_2, --gradient_checkpointing, --packing_samples
      - Keep: do NOT set ring_attn_size on 2 GPUs
  - OpenRLHF (utils/deepspeed/deepspeed_utils.py → get_train_ds_config):
      - Set zero_quantized_gradients: True
      - Set zero_quantized_weights: True
      - Optionally expose expert_parallel_size as an arg, but for 2 GPUs I recommend leaving EP=1 to preserve DP=2. If you scale to 4+ GPUs, set EP to a divisor of world size that still leaves DP>1.

  If you want, I can draft the exact flag changes for 073 and a small patch to OpenRLHF to enable Zero++ quantization and make expert_parallel_size configurable.



> Short version:

  - On 2 GPUs, ring_attn_size=2 will drop DP to 1 in your OpenRLHF mesh, which removes ZeRO‑2 sharding. You’ll save some activation memory but lose gradient/optimizer sharding — net memory gets worse and step time increases. I don’t recommend ring attention on a 2‑GPU ZeRO‑2
  setup if your goal is “keep 8k seq length”.
  - grad_accum_dtype=bf16 is generally stable for SFT in bf16. It halves the grad‑accum buffer and is a good lever. Keep gradient clipping; watch for NaNs, but it’s rarely an issue with bf16.
  - ZeRO‑3 typically costs ~5–15% throughput on a 2‑GPU single node, but it shards weights and grads so it’s far easier to fit 8k. DS‑MoE doesn’t support ZeRO‑3, so this means giving up DS‑MoE, but with only 2 GPUs you weren’t getting useful EP anyway.

  Details and trade‑offs

  - Ring Attention on 2 GPUs
      - Effect on DP: OpenRLHF computes dp_size = world/(ring_attn_size×tp). With 2 GPUs and ring_attn_size=2, dp_size→1. ZeRO‑2 sharding disappears.
      - Memory: You’ll reduce attention activations (often 30–40% of total activations), but weights, grads, and optimizer now sit unsharded per rank. Net memory increases substantially; it won’t “let you keep 8k” in this 2‑GPU regime.
      - Speed: Not a 2× slowdown, but expect 20–60% longer step time from extra collectives; savings in compute rarely compensate at this scale.
  - grad_accum_dtype=bf16
      - Stability: bf16 has a large exponent range. Accumulating grads in bf16 is widely used and stable for LLM SFT at your LR. Keep --max_norm and monitor for NaNs; if you ever see issues, revert to default (fp32) only for debug.
      - Memory: Cuts grad‑accum buffers ~2×. On your budgets this is a meaningful lever.
  - Switching to ZeRO‑3
      - DS‑MoE: As you note, DS‑MoE is ZeRO‑2‑only. ZeRO‑3 means you lose DS‑MoE EP. On 2 GPUs that’s fine — EP=2 would have set DP=1 and hurt memory anyway.
      - Memory: ZeRO‑3 shards weights and grads. With AdamW 4‑bit (TorchAO) even if the states aren’t partitioned by DS, you’re likely to fit 8k at micro=1:
          - Rough: weights ~29 GB + grads ~15 GB (bf16 accum) + optimizer 4‑bit ~30 GB + activations ~6–10 GB ≈ 80–84 GB.
      - Throughput: On a single node with NVLink/PCIe gen4, plan for ~5–15% slower per‑token throughput vs ZeRO‑2, but you gain back by running full 8k without OOM or micro=1 choking.

  Recommended paths to preserve 8k

  - Stay ZeRO‑2 + DS‑MoE (no ring attention), push memory levers:
      - --micro_train_batch_size 1
      - --grad_accum_dtype bf16
      - --optimizer adamw_torchao_4bit (halve optimizer state vs 8‑bit)
      - Enable Zero++ in DS config: zero_quantized_gradients: true, zero_quantized_weights: true
      - Optional: freeze embeddings and lm_head to save grads/opt state.
      - This might fit at 8k only if the 4‑bit states are also sharded; if TorchAO states can’t be partitioned under ZeRO‑2 in your build, it will still be tight.
  - Switch to ZeRO‑3 (drop DS‑MoE), keep compute efficiency from MoE’s top‑k but no EP:
      - --zero_stage 3, --micro_train_batch_size 1, --grad_accum_dtype bf16, --optimizer adamw_torchao_4bit
      - Expect ~5–15% slower, but the memory headroom is sufficient to run 8k cleanly.

  Rule of thumb on the three knobs for your 2×96GB box:

  - Ring attention 2: No (on 2 GPUs it removes DP and hurts memory).
  - grad_accum_dtype bf16: Yes (good memory savings, typically stable).
  - ZeRO‑3: Yes if you need 8k and can forgo DS‑MoE; small perf penalty but far better fit.

  If you want, I can:

  - Edit the DS config in your OpenRLHF helper to flip on Zero++ quantization and add a --optimizer adamw_torchao_4bit variant.
  - Draft a ZeRO‑3 version of 073 with the exact flags to keep 8k and micro=1, so you can A/B throughput and memory.


▌Can you tell me what the zero++ settings actually do and how that affects memory usage and flops?

> Here’s what those ZeRO++ settings do, and their practical impact.

  What ZeRO++ Quantization Does

  - zero_quantized_gradients: true
      - Quantizes gradient communication/buffers used by ZeRO (e.g., reduce-scatter/all-reduce, contiguous grad buffers) from bf16/fp16 to a lower-bit format (typically 8-bit).
      - Dequantizes before accumulation/updates so computation still happens in bf16/fp32 as usual.
  - zero_quantized_weights: true
      - Quantizes parameter shards and temporary all‑gather buffers used by ZeRO during forward/backward/update steps (often to 4–8 bits depending on DS version/path).
      - Dequantizes when needed for math; model compute still runs in bf16.

  These toggles do not change your model’s compute dtype; they only compress ZeRO’s internal comm/state buffers.

  Memory Impact

  - Gradients: ~2× smaller ZeRO grad communication/contiguous buffers vs bf16. This directly cuts a large resident chunk in ZeRO‑2.
  - Weights (ZeRO’s temp/full buffers): typically ~2–4× smaller for parameter all‑gather/repartition buffers. This reduces transient spikes and some persistent partition caches.
  - What they don’t change:
      - The bf16 model weights that the kernel reads.
      - Optimizer state size (use TorchAO 4‑/8‑bit or offload to reduce those).
      - Activation memory.

  Net effect: noticeable GPU memory savings (often tens of GB on 30B‑class models under ZeRO‑2), plus smaller comm buffers → fewer OOMs and more headroom for sequence length or micro‑batch.

  FLOPs/Speed Impact

  - Extra compute: small overhead for quantize/dequantize (integer pack/unpack + scaling). This is cheap relative to forward/backward FLOPs.
  - Communication: fewer bytes sent. If you’re bandwidth‑bound, steps can be faster. On single‑node NVLink you may see little speedup, but you still get memory relief.
  - Typical runtime change: ±0–5% from q/dq overhead; sometimes a net gain if comm was the bottleneck.

  Accuracy/Stability

  - Training compute stays bf16/fp32. Quantization is applied to comm/buffers with appropriate scaling; dequant happens before sensitive ops (clip/update).
  - In practice, no instability issues for SFT at your LRs. Keep grad clipping enabled and monitor for NaNs as usual.

  Interplay With Your Other Knobs

  - Orthogonal to optimizer quantization: TorchAO 4‑/8‑bit shrinks optimizer states; ZeRO++ shrinks ZeRO grad/weight buffers. Use both for cumulative savings.
  - Works with --grad_accum_dtype bf16: that reduces grad‑accum precision/size; ZeRO++ further compresses comm/buffers.
  - Compatible with DS‑MoE + ZeRO‑2 (your case). It doesn’t enable expert parallelism by itself.

  When It Helps Most

  - ZeRO‑2 on small DP (like your 2 GPUs), where grads and ZeRO buffers are otherwise large and replicated.
  - Long sequence lengths (big activations) where transient weight all‑gathers can trigger OOM.

  If you want, I can add a CLI flag to toggle these at runtime, but enabling them by default (as we did) is a good default for your 2×96GB runs.


> Good catch — your logs show ZeRO‑3 is trying to set up, but the model gets fully instantiated on GPU before the ZeRO engine shards it. Then, when ZeRO‑3 allocates its partitions (bf16 shards and the fp32 master shards), it runs out of memory.

  What happened and why

  - Full replica before sharding: MA/CA ~57–58 GB right at “Stage 3 initialize beginning” means the model was already sitting on GPU memory when deepspeed.initialize() started. That defeats the “no full replica” benefit of ZeRO‑3 and makes the subsequent partition allocations
  push you over the edge.
  - FP32 master partitions are required: ZeRO‑3 builds fp32 master parameter partitions for the optimizer even with bf16 training and even if m/v are 4‑bit. Your OOM occurs precisely at _create_fp32_partitions(), which is expected to add ~4 bytes/param shard on top of the bf16
  shard.
  - Why the full replica slipped in: with use_liger_kernel and trust_remote_code, HF’s ZeRO‑3 zero.Init hook can get bypassed or not strictly enforce CPU instantiation. The tell is the high CA before partitioning and then another jump during “After creating fp16 partitions…”.

  What I changed to fix the “full replica before sharding”

  - I updated both model loaders to force CPU placement when ZeRO‑3 is active so HF/DeepSpeed can partition without first materializing on GPU:
      - OpenRLHF/openrlhf/models/actor.py
      - OpenRLHF/openrlhf/models/model.py
  - Behavior with ZeRO‑3:
      - Adds low_cpu_mem_usage=True
      - Forces device_map={"": "cpu"} at load time when HfDeepSpeedConfig is present
      - Result: you should see a small MA/CA before DS init (a few GiB), not ~58 GiB. Then ZeRO‑3 will create bf16 partitions, and then fp32 master partitions, without needing an extra full replica on GPU.

  What to expect on re-run

  - At “Stage 3 initialize beginning”, MA/CA should be low (no 58 GB spike).
  - After “creating fp16 partitions” and then “creating fp32 partitions”, you should end up around the rough budgets we discussed:
      - 4096 tokens: ~78–82 GB if TorchAO 4‑bit states are sharded, ~92–97 GB if not.
      - 8192 tokens: ~81–87 GB if sharded, ~96–104 GB if not.
  - If you’re still borderline at 8k, two quick levers:
      - Reduce ZeRO bucket sizes to lower peak memory during partition creation:
          - In DS config, set "reduce_bucket_size": 200000000 and "stage3_prefetch_bucket_size": 20000000 (smaller buckets reduce spikes at a small perf cost).
      - Freeze embeddings and/or lm_head to save grad and optimizer state.

  Why fp32 master still appears under ZeRO‑3

  - ZeRO‑3 keeps bf16 shards for forward/backward and maintains fp32 master parameter shards for updates. Even with 4‑bit optimizer m/v, the master weight shards are fp32. That is the extra allocation that failed in your log. With the CPU-first load fix, there’s now space for
  them.

  Recap of your current knobs (good)

  - Zero++ quantization is enabled (reduces grad/param comm buffers).
  - TorchAO AdamW 4‑bit (shrinks m/v).
  - grad_accum_dtype bf16 (saves grad accum).
  - micro_train_batch_size 1.
  - max_len 4096 now; try 8192 after confirming headroom at 4k.

  If you’d like, I can also add optional DS config knobs in our generator to tune reduce/prefetch bucket sizes when stage==3 so you can flip them per run without editing code.
